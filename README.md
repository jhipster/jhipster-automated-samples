JHipster automated samples
==========================

This project is for generating the JHipster sample projects.

- The sample projects must be cloned with the `clone_samples.sh` script in a subdirectory (delete existing directory if necessary).
- Then each project is updated with the `generate_projects.sh` script
- Then each project License is updated with the `add_licenses.sh` script
